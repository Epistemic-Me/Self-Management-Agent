# Archive Directory

This directory contains superseded implementation plans that were consolidated into the unified `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` at the project root.

## Archived Files

### `legacy_implementation_plan.md`
- **Original**: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (root level)
- **Focus**: Client-driven reusable tasks with detailed UI/UX mockups
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive user experience designs, technical implementation details
- **Limitations**: Not aligned with Memory×Provenance×Self-Model roadmap

### `roadmap_implementation_plan.md`  
- **Original**: `docs/implementation_plan.md`
- **Focus**: Memory×Provenance×Self-Model architecture with L0-L4 evaluation levels
- **Strengths**: Clear architectural thesis, systematic evaluation framework
- **Limitations**: Lacked detailed UI/UX specifications and client management features

## Consolidation

These two approaches were merged into the unified `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` that:

- **Adopts** Memory×Provenance×Self-Model as core architectural thesis
- **Preserves** detailed UI/UX mockups and client management workflows
- **Maintains** L0-L4 evaluation progression framework  
- **Aligns** with existing GitHub epic structure (#69-72, #73-88)
- **Provides** single source of truth for business, technical, and project management teams

## Reference

For analysis of conflicts and reconciliation strategy, see:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed comparison and gap analysis
- `../strategic/GITHUB_ISSUES_COMPLETE_RECONCILIATION.md` - GitHub issue alignment summary

The unified plan eliminates conflicts between customer journey phases, technical architecture, and GitHub project structure while preserving the best elements of both approaches.
