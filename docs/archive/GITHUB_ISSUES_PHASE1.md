After setting up your GitHub repository with the structure above, you can quickly create all Phase 1 issues using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# brew install gh (macOS) or follow instructions at https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Navigate to your repository
cd path/to/Self-Management-Agent

# Create milestone for Phase 1
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones -f title="Phase 1: Foundation & Audit Infrastructure" -f description="Client onboarding, trace collection, and project management infrastructure" -f due_on="2024-02-15T00:00:00Z"

# Create Epic issues (these create the parent issues)
gh issue create --title "[EPIC 1.1] Client Onboarding & Project Management System" --label "type:epic,epic:1.1-client-onboarding,phase:1-foundation,priority:high" --body-file epic-1-1-description.md

# Continue with individual feature issues...
gh issue create --title "[FEATURE] Client Portal Landing Page with Progress Tracking" --label "type:feature,epic:1.1-client-onboarding,phase:1-foundation,priority:high,component:frontend" --body-file issue-2-description.md
```

This gives you a complete GitHub project structure that maps directly to the implementation plan with clear tracking and progress visibility.
