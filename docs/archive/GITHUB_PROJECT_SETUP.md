This setup provides a complete GitHub project structure that maps directly to our implementation plan. Each phase becomes a milestone, each epic becomes a trackable set of issues, and the project board provides visual progress tracking.

Would you like me to proceed with creating the specific GitHub issues for Phase 1 to get you started?
