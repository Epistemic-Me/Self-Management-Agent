## Issues Re-linked

### Updated Epic Associations
- **Issue #67** (Open Coding Interface): Moved from `epic:2.1-open-coding` to `epic:3.1-working-memory`
- **Issue #34** (Progressive Input Complexity): Moved from `epic:5.1-self-model-input` to `epic:5.1-self-model`
- **Issue #35** (User Context Viewer): Moved from `epic:5.1-self-model-input` to `epic:5.1-self-model`
- **Issue #36** (Belief System Integration): Moved from `epic:5.1-self-model-input` to `epic:5.1-self-model`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Close or update conflicting old epics (#33, #37) 
2. Create sub-issues for each new epic's implementation tasks
3. Update phase names if needed to reflect roadmap terminology
4. Assign team members to specific epics

### Architecture Alignment
- Ensure all new features reference the Core Thesis: Memory × Provenance × Self-Model
- Update implementation tasks to build incrementally (L0→L1→L2→L3→L4)
- Integrate evaluation metrics from the new metric bundles

### Timeline Considerations
- Weeks 1-4: Foundation (existing issues)
- Weeks 5-6: Working Memory implementation
- Weeks 7-8: Provenance Manager development
- Weeks 9-10: Self-Model integration
- Weeks 11-12: Epistemic Model & recommendations

## GitHub Metadata Compliance
All new epics include:
- ✅ Type: Epic (using GitHub API)
- ✅ Project: Self-Management Agent - Customer Journey
- ✅ Appropriate phase labels
- ✅ Priority: high
- ✅ Component labels (backend + frontend)
- ✅ Epic labels following X.Y-name format
- ✅ Assignee: jonmc12

This alignment ensures our GitHub issues now fully reflect the Memory×Provenance×Self-Model 
architecture from the roadmap, with clear progression from basic I/O evaluation (L0) to 
personalized recommendations (L4).
