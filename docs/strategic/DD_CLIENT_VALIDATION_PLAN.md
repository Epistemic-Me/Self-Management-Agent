# DD Client Validation Plan
## Strategic Decision Framework Testing with Real Client Data

*Based on team context discussion - 2025-06-18*

---

## üéØ **Validation Objectives**

### **Primary Goal**: Test decision framework with DD client traces before updating all 48+ issues
### **Key Constraint**: Avoid regressions in team alignment tools

---

## üìä **DD Client Context Analysis**

### **Current State**:
- **Traces Available**: AI Bryan traces.csv (Issue #2 comment)
- **Data Type**: User input + AI chatbot output only (no full toolchain)
- **Evaluation Depth**: Surface-level learnings so far
- **Client Setup**: AWS Bedrock, MCP server access control
- **Repo Structure**: Self-management-agent already built for this case

### **Decision Framework Application**:

#### **DD Client Assessment**:
```
Client Profile: DD (Don't Die)
‚îú‚îÄ Error Rate: Unknown (need analysis)
‚îú‚îÄ Maturity Level: Established (has AWS Bedrock setup)
‚îú‚îÄ Business Priority: Health/Safety (compliance critical)
‚îú‚îÄ Data Available: User inputs + AI outputs
‚îî‚îÄ Infrastructure: AWS Bedrock + MCP servers
```

#### **Recommended Focus**: **OUTPUT-FOCUSED** (Error Analysis First)
**Rationale**: 
- Health/safety domain requires error analysis priority
- Surface-level learnings indicate need for deeper failure analysis
- Missing toolchain context suggests output quality issues
- Compliance/safety bias toward error prevention

---

## üî¨ **Prototype Framework**

### **Phase 1: DD Client Decision Framework Validation**

#### **Step 1: Trace Analysis with Decision Lens**
```bash
# Analyze DD traces with both focus approaches
Input Focus Questions:
- What user intents are most common?
- What user contexts are missing?
- How could personalization improve responses?

Output Focus Questions:
- What failure modes appear in responses?
- Where does the AI provide incorrect health information?
- What safety risks exist in current outputs?
```

#### **Step 2: Create DD-Specific Issue Templates**
- Test reusable task architecture with real client needs
- Validate terminology worksheet approach
- Prototype decision checkpoint system

#### **Step 3: Validate Tool Integration Needs**
- Test CSV export with DD traces
- Verify format compatibility requirements
- Document integration gaps

## üöÄ **Implementation Sequence**

### **Week 1: DD Client Validation**

#### **Day 1-2: Framework Testing**
1. **Download DD traces** from Issue #2 comment
2. **Apply decision framework** to real data
3. **Test Input vs Output analysis** approaches
4. **Document findings** and framework adjustments

#### **Day 3-4: Prototype Key Issues**
1. **Issue #1**: Create DD-specific client onboarding prototype
2. **Issue #8**: Test configurable workflow with DD traces  
3. **Issue #17**: Prototype CSV export with DD data
4. **Issue #2**: Test decision gate UI concept

#### **Day 5: Validation Review**
1. **Team review** of prototype results
2. **Framework refinements** based on DD experience
3. **Go/No-Go decision** for full issue updates

### **Week 2: Phased Issue Updates (if validated)**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Issues (Mon-Wed)**
- Issues #1, #2, #4 (architectural changes)
- Create 4 new issues (assessment framework, etc.)
- Add decision logs and update dates

#### **Phase 2: Workflow Issues (Thu-Fri)**  
- Issues #8, #17 (workflow and integration)
- Test updated issues with DD client context

### **Week 3: Complete Rollout**
- Remaining 43 issues (terminology worksheet additions)
- Cross-epic validation
- Final DD client testing

---

## üìã **Validation Criteria**

### **Success Metrics**:
- [ ] Decision framework correctly identifies DD client needs
- [ ] Reusable task architecture works for real client engagement
- [ ] CSV export handles DD traces properly
- [ ] Terminology worksheet process is practical
- [ ] Issue updates maintain team alignment (no regressions)
- [ ] DD client use case validates strategic direction

### **Failure Conditions**:
- Decision framework doesn't match DD client reality
- Reusable task architecture too complex for practical use
- Issue updates break team workflow
- Strategic changes don't improve DD client value

---

## üîß **Technical Validation Setup**

### **DD Client Environment**:
```bash
# Create DD validation branch
git checkout -b dd-client-validation

# Setup DD-specific testing
mkdir -p validation/dd-client/
# Download AI Bryan traces.csv to validation/dd-client/
# Create DD-specific decision framework test
```

### **Issue Update Process**:
1. **Create draft updates** in separate branch
2. **Test with DD client scenario**
3. **Team review** before merging to main
4. **Batch updates** by phase to minimize disruption

---

## üéØ **Expected Outcomes**

### **If Validation Succeeds**:
- Confident rollout to all 48+ issues
- Proven framework for future client engagements
- DD client becomes reference implementation
- Strategic direction validated with real data

### **If Validation Reveals Issues**:
- Framework adjustments before full rollout
- Reduced scope of changes to minimize risk
- Alternative approaches for different client types
- Lessons learned for future strategic decisions

---

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Get team approval** for this validation approach
2. **Download DD traces** and begin framework testing
3. **Create prototype issue updates** for key issues
4. **Schedule validation review** after Week 1
5. **Decide on full rollout** based on DD client results

This approach ensures we validate the strategic decisions with real client data before making extensive changes that could impact team alignment.
