## âœ… **GitHub Compliance Checklist**

### All Issues Have:
- [x] **Proper Naming**: [EPIC X.Y] or [FEATURE] format
- [x] **Complete Metadata**: Type, Priority, Phase, Epic, Component labels
- [x] **Milestone Assignment**: Mapped to appropriate phase milestones
- [x] **Project Board**: Added to "Self-Management Agent - Customer Journey"
- [x] **Epic Linkage**: Sub-issues properly linked to parent epics
- [x] **Issue Type**: Set correctly in GitHub's type system
- [x] **Assignee**: Assigned to @jonmc12
- [x] **Word Count**: All under 500 words as required

### Parent-Child Relationships:
- [x] Epic #69 has 4 sub-issues (#73-76) âœ…
- [x] Epic #70 has 4 sub-issues (#77-80) âœ…
- [x] Epic #71 has 4 sub-issues (#81-84) âœ…
- [x] Epic #72 has 4 sub-issues (#85-88) âœ…

## âœ… **Re-linked Existing Issues**
- **#67** (Open Coding Interface): Moved to `epic:2.3-working-memory`
- **#34** (Progressive Input Complexity): Linked to `epic:5.3-self-model`
- **#35** (User Context Viewer): Linked to `epic:5.3-self-model`
- **#36** (Belief System Integration): Linked to `epic:5.3-self-model`

## âœ… **Roadmap Alignment**

### L0 â†’ L4 Progression Mapped:
- **L0** (I/O): Foundation epics (existing 1.x issues)
- **L1** (Agent + Tools): Epic 2.3 Working Memory âœ…
- **L2** (Multi-turn): Epic 3.3 Provenance Manager âœ…
- **L3** (Adaptive): Epic 5.3 Self-Model âœ…
- **L4** (Personalized): Epic 6.3 Epistemic Model âœ…

### Core Thesis Integration:
Each epic implements part of "Memory Ã— Provenance Ã— Self-Model = Bridge from Basic RAG to Personalised Recommendations"

## âœ… **Project Board Ready**
The GitHub project board now shows:
- Clear epic structure with proper numbering
- All epics have implementable sub-issues
- Proper phase progression
- No orphaned features
- Complete traceability from epics to sub-issues

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider closing conflicting old epics (#33, #37) if not needed
2. Begin implementation starting with Epic 2.3 (Working Memory)
3. Update team assignments for specific epics if needed
