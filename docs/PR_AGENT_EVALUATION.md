# Pull Request: Agent Evaluation - Hierarchical Constraint Architecture

## Overview
This PR implements the Agent Evaluation feature, introducing a Hierarchical Constraint Architecture for systematic LLM evaluation that integrates with the existing open coding workflow.

## Issue Reference
Parent Issue: #64 (Epic 2.3 - Rapid Iteration Interface)
Issue Type: Feature

## Summary
The Agent Evaluation system helps developers navigate the "three gulfs" of LLM development (comprehension, specification, generalization) by:
- Providing a hierarchical constraint-based evaluation framework
- Integrating with existing failure modes from open coding analysis
- Enabling systematic evaluation of agent performance across different contexts
- Supporting constraint violation tracking and failure mode prediction

## Key Changes

### New Files Created
1. **Type Definitions** (`web-ui/src/types/agent-evaluation.ts`)
   - Complete type system for hierarchical constraint evaluation
   - Integration with existing DatasetFailureMode interface
   - Node types: root, cohort, intent, category, subintent

2. **Main Page** (`web-ui/src/app/agent-evaluation/page.tsx`)
   - Dashboard with evaluation statistics
   - Split-view layout with tree and details panels
   - Integration with existing evaluation workflow

3. **Core Components**
   - `HierarchicalTree.tsx`: Interactive tree visualization with expandable nodes
   - `ConstraintManager.tsx`: Add/edit/delete constraints with category support
   - `EvaluationMetrics.tsx`: Node metrics and failure mode display
   - `OpenCodingIntegration.tsx`: Modal for linking failure modes from open coding

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/agent-evaluation/hierarchy.ts`: Get/update hierarchy data
   - `/api/agent-evaluation/constraints/[nodeId].ts`: Manage node constraints
   - `/api/agent-evaluation/metrics/[nodeId].ts`: Retrieve evaluation metrics

5. **UI Components**
   - `input.tsx` and `select.tsx`: Basic form components for constraint management

### Modified Files
1. **SidebarNav.tsx**: Added "Agent Evaluation" menu item with Target icon

## Testing Instructions

### Setup
1. Ensure the development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Basic Navigation
- [ ] Click "Agent Evaluation" in the sidebar
- [ ] Verify the page loads without errors
- [ ] Confirm the dashboard statistics are displayed

#### 2. Hierarchical Tree Interaction
- [ ] Expand/collapse tree nodes
- [ ] Click on different nodes to view details
- [ ] Verify tier information tooltips appear on hover
- [ ] Check that node metrics are displayed correctly

#### 3. Constraint Management
- [ ] Select a node in the tree
- [ ] Add a new constraint:
  - Click "Add Constraint"
  - Select a category (e.g., "safety", "data_sources")
  - Enter constraint text
  - Save the constraint
- [ ] Edit an existing constraint
- [ ] Delete a constraint
- [ ] Verify constraints are properly categorized with color coding

#### 4. Open Coding Integration
- [ ] Click "Link Open Coding Results" button
- [ ] Verify the modal opens
- [ ] Check that existing datasets are listed
- [ ] Test the mapping configuration options

#### 5. Responsive Design
- [ ] Resize the browser window
- [ ] Verify the layout adapts appropriately
- [ ] Check that all features remain accessible

## Regression Testing

### Existing Features to Verify
1. **Open Coding Workflow**
   - [ ] Navigate to Evaluation page
   - [ ] Confirm open coding analysis still works
   - [ ] Verify failure modes are properly tracked

2. **Prompt Iteration**
   - [ ] Check that prompt iteration interface is unaffected
   - [ ] Verify axial coding step functions correctly

3. **Other Pages**
   - [ ] User Workbench loads correctly
   - [ ] Chat interface functions normally
   - [ ] Datasets page displays properly

## Review Checklist

### Code Quality
**Acceptable:**
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined and used consistently
- [ ] Components follow existing React patterns in the codebase
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in development
- [ ] Code follows existing naming conventions

**Unacceptable:**
- [ ] Any TypeScript errors or type mismatches
- [ ] Inconsistent component structure compared to existing code
- [ ] Console errors or unhandled promises
- [ ] Deviation from established patterns without justification

### UI/UX Consistency
**Acceptable:**
- [ ] UI components match existing design system
- [ ] Interactive elements have appropriate hover/active states
- [ ] Loading states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error states provide clear feedback

**Unacceptable:**
- [ ] Visual inconsistencies with existing UI
- [ ] Missing loading or error states
- [ ] Unresponsive or broken interactions
- [ ] Accessibility issues (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

### Integration Points
**Acceptable:**
- [ ] Seamless integration with open coding workflow
- [ ] Data models extend existing types appropriately
- [ ] API endpoints follow established patterns
- [ ] State management is consistent with app architecture

**Unacceptable:**
- [ ] Breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Data model conflicts or duplications
- [ ] State management anti-patterns
- [ ] Tight coupling that prevents future extensions

### Performance
**Acceptable:**
- [ ] Page loads quickly with sample data
- [ ] Tree interactions are responsive
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] Efficient re-renders on state changes

**Unacceptable:**
- [ ] Slow initial page load (>3 seconds)
- [ ] Laggy tree interactions
- [ ] Memory usage increases over time
- [ ] Unnecessary full-page re-renders

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Implemented as recursive tree with node types (root, cohort, intent, category, subintent)
2. **Constraint Categories**: Seven categories for comprehensive evaluation coverage
3. **Integration Pattern**: Loosely coupled with open coding through shared failure mode types
4. **State Management**: Local component state with API persistence

### Known Limitations
1. Sample data is currently hardcoded in API endpoint
2. Real-time collaboration features not yet implemented
3. Export functionality planned for future iteration

### Future Enhancements
1. Persist hierarchy and constraints to database
2. Add collaboration features for team evaluation
3. Implement constraint templates library
4. Add export/import functionality for evaluation configurations

## Estimated Review Time
**15-20 minutes** for code review
**10-15 minutes** for implementation testing
**Total: 25-35 minutes**
