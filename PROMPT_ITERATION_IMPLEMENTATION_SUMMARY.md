### Technical Architecture

#### Data Flow
```
Dataset Selection → Prompt Versions → Comparison → AI Suggestions → Apply → New Version
                                   ↘                              ↗
                                    Analytics ← Metrics Collection
```

#### API Integration
- **`/api/prompt-iteration/suggest`**: Generates improvement suggestions
- **`/api/prompt-iteration/compare`**: Runs A/B tests between versions
- Graceful error handling with fallback mock data
- Real-time updates with loading states

#### Component Architecture
```
