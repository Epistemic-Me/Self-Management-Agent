# Testing Strategy

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- **Solid Foundation**: Well-configured test infrastructure with pytest-asyncio
- **Integration Testing**: Tests use real HTTP clients and database connections
- **Good Fixtures**: Clean test fixtures for user creation and session management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing section in development docs

### ❌ Critical Gaps
- **Coverage**: Only 5 tests for 7 router modules (71% module coverage)
- **Scenarios**: Limited to happy path testing, missing error cases
- **Authentication**: Inconsistent auth testing patterns
- **Database**: No transaction isolation between tests

## Testing Strategy Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Enhanced Test Configuration
```python
# tests/conftest.py improvements
- ✅ Added proper session rollback
- ✅ Created reusable auth_headers fixture  
- ✅ Added Redis client fixture
- ✅ Fixed linting issues
```

#### 1.2 Missing Module Coverage
```bash
# New test files needed:
- ✅ tests/test_measurement.py (created)
- ✅ tests/test_belief.py (created)
- ⏳ tests/test_file.py
- ⏳ tests/test_trend.py
```

### Phase 2: Test Quality Enhancement

#### 2.1 Error Handling Tests
```python
# Add to all test modules:
- HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)
- HTTP 403 (Forbidden) 
- HTTP 422 (Validation Error)
- HTTP 404 (Not Found)
- HTTP 500 (Server Error)
```

#### 2.2 Edge Case Testing
```python
# Test scenarios:
- Invalid UUIDs
- Malformed JSON
- Missing required fields
- Boundary values (min/max)
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
```

#### 2.3 Database Testing
```python
# Improvements needed:
- Isolated test database
- Transaction rollback per test
- Foreign key constraint testing
- Concurrent access testing
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing

#### 3.1 Performance Testing
```python
# Load testing with pytest-benchmark:
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Concurrent user handling
```

#### 3.2 Security Testing
```python
# Security test scenarios:
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization boundary testing
- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting verification
```

#### 3.3 Integration Testing
```python
# Full stack testing:
- Redis authentication flow
- MinIO file upload/download
- Database migration testing
- Service dependency testing
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
```python
# Test individual functions/methods
- Model validation logic
- CRUD operations
- Utility functions
- Business logic
```

### 2. Integration Tests  
```python
# Test component interactions
- API endpoint flows
- Database operations
- Redis operations
- External service calls
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests
```python
# Test complete user workflows
- User onboarding flow
- Belief system creation
- File upload/management
- Progress tracking
```

### 4. Contract Tests
```python
# Test API contracts
- Request/response schemas
- Error response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting behavior
```

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test Structure
```python
# Follow AAA pattern:
def test_function_name():
    # Arrange - Set up test data
    # Act - Execute the function
    # Assert - Verify the results
```

### 2. Test Naming
```python
# Descriptive test names:
test_create_measurement_success()
test_create_measurement_invalid_user_id()
test_create_measurement_validation_error()
test_get_measurements_unauthorized()
```

### 3. Test Data Management
```python
# Use factories for test data:
@pytest.fixture
def measurement_data():
    return {
        "type": "weight",
        "value": 70.5,
        "unit": "kg",
        "captured_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
```

### 4. Assertion Patterns
```python
# Comprehensive assertions:
assert response.status_code == 200
assert response.json()["status"] == "ok"
assert "id" in response.json()["data"]
assert isinstance(response.json()["data"]["items"], list)
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- ✅ Enhanced conftest.py
- ✅ Created test_measurement.py
- ✅ Created test_belief.py
- ⏳ Create test_file.py
- ⏳ Create test_trend.py

### Week 2: Error Handling
- Add validation error tests to all modules
- Add authentication error tests
- Add not found error tests
- Add server error tests

### Week 3: Edge Cases
- Add boundary value testing
- Add malformed input testing
- Add concurrent access testing
- Add constraint violation testing

### Week 4: Advanced Testing
- Set up performance testing
- Implement security testing
- Add contract testing
- Set up CI/CD integration

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track
- Test coverage percentage
- Test execution time
- Test reliability (flaky test rate)
- Bug detection rate

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly test coverage reports
- Monthly test strategy reviews
- Quarterly performance benchmarks
- Annual security test audits

## Tools and Dependencies

### Current Tools
```
pytest==8.3.1
pytest-asyncio==0.23.6
respx==0.22.0
httpx (for AsyncClient)
```

### Recommended Additions
```
pytest-cov (coverage reporting)
pytest-benchmark (performance testing)
pytest-xdist (parallel testing)
pytest-mock (mocking utilities)
factory-boy (test data factories)
faker (fake data generation)
```

## Conclusion

The current testing foundation is solid but needs significant expansion. The immediate focus should be on achieving 100% module coverage and adding comprehensive error handling tests. This will provide a robust safety net for future development and refactoring efforts.

The testing strategy should evolve iteratively, with regular reviews and adjustments based on project needs and discovered gaps. The goal is to build confidence in the codebase while maintaining development velocity.
